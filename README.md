With these integrations configured, Sysmon and Windows Defender logs will be forwarded to Elasticsearch, making them available for analysis and monitoring in Kibana.
Day 11: Introduction to Brute Force Attacks
Today, I'm learning about brute-force attacks, a common method where attackers systematically try different combinations of characters to guess passwords, API keys, or SSH logins. It's essential to understand this attack vector to strengthen my defenses.
Day 12: Installation of Ubuntu Server version 24.02
To broaden my attack surface, I'm adding an Ubuntu Server to my Vultr environment. This will allow me to simulate attacks against a Linux system, adding another dimension to my SOC challenge.
Day 13: Installation of Agent in Ubuntu Server
Just like with my Windows Server, I'm deploying an Elastic Agent to my Ubuntu Server. This ensures centralized visibility and management of security data from both Windows and Linux systems.
Here's how:
1.	Create Agent Policy: In Kibana's Fleet section, create a new agent policy with appropriate settings for your Ubuntu server.
2.	Enroll a New Agent: Click "Add Agent," select the policy you created, and choose the "Linux" integration.
3.	Copy the Installation Command: Copy the provided installation command.
4.	SSH to Ubuntu Server: Connect to your Ubuntu server via SSH.
5.	Execute the Command: Paste and run the installation command in your SSH session.
Day 14: Creating Alerts and Dashboard in Kibana - SSH
It's time to create alerts and a dashboard in Kibana to monitor for SSH brute-force attacks on my Ubuntu Server.
Here's how:
1.	Discover SSH Events:
o	In Kibana, go to the "Discover" tab.
o	Filter for events from your Ubuntu Server's agent.
o	Analyze the SSH logs, focusing on fields like system.auth.ssh.event for authentication events.
2.	Create an Alert:

o	Configure notifications (email, Slack, etc.).
3.	Build a Dashboard:
o	Go to the "Dashboards" tab and create a new dashboard.
o	Add visualizations to display relevant information, such as: 
	A map showing the geographical location of SSH login attempts.
	A bar chart showing the number of failed logins over time.
	A table listing the usernames and IP addresses involved in failed logins.
Day 15: Remote Desktop Protocol Introduction
Today, I'm learning about the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), a valuable tool for remote access, but also a potential security risk if not properly secured. Attackers often exploit RDP vulnerabilities, including using brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.
Day 16: Creating Alerts and Dashboard in Kibana - RDP Brute Force
I'll set up alerts and a dashboard in Kibana specifically for RDP brute-force attacks against my Windows Server.
Here's how:
1.	Discover RDP Events:

Day 17: Creating Alerts and Dashboard - with Maps
I want to see the bigger picture of the attacks targeting my network. Today, I'm combining the alerts and dashboards I created for SSH and RDP brute-force attacks into a single, comprehensive view. Kibana's mapping capabilities will help me visualize where in the world these attacks are coming from.
Here's how I created the combined map:
1.	Create a New Map: In Kibana, go to the "Maps" tab and create a new map.
2.	Add SSH Brute-force Layer: 
o	Use the query from your SSH brute-force alert to filter the data.
o	Set the "Source" to "Elastic Maps Service" to use pre-defined geographical boundaries.
o	Select source.geo.country_name as the field to visualize on the map. This will color-code countries based on the number of SSH brute-force attempts originating from them.
3.	Add RDP Brute-force Layer: 
o	Repeat the steps above, but use the query from your RDP brute-force alert.
o	Ensure you select the same "Source" (Elastic Maps Service) and use source.geo.country_name for consistency.
Now I have a single map that displays both SSH and RDP brute-force attacks, giving me a clear visual representation of the global threat landscape targeting my honeypot network.
Day 18: Introduction to Command and Control
Today, I'm diving into the world of Command and Control (C2) frameworks. These are the tools and infrastructure that attackers use to communicate with and control compromised systems. Understanding how C2 works is crucial for defenders to detect and disrupt malicious activities.
Day 19: Creating an Attack Diagram
To better understand and plan my attack simulations, I'm creating a diagram that outlines the typical stages of a cyberattack:
1.	Initial Access: How the attacker gains a foothold in the network (e.g., phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities).
2.	Discovery: The attacker explores the network to identify valuable assets and information.
3.	Defense Evasion: The attacker tries to avoid detection by security tools.
4.	Execution: The attacker runs malicious code on the compromised system.
5.	Command and Control: The attacker establishes a communication channel to control the compromised system.
6.	Exfiltration: The attacker steals data or achieves other malicious objectives.
This diagram will help me visualize the attacker's mindset and identify potential weaknesses in my defenses.
Day 20: Mythic Setup – Building My Attacker Lair
Time to get hands-on with Mythic, a powerful C2 framework! I'm setting up a Mythic server on Vultr.com.

3.	Configure Mythic: 
o	Create Users: Set up user accounts with appropriate permissions for managing and interacting with Mythic.
o	Configure Listeners: Listeners define how Mythic agents will communicate with the C2 server (e.g., HTTP, DNS). Configure listeners based on your needs and the attack scenarios you want to simulate.
o	Payload Types: Familiarize yourself with the different payload types available in Mythic for various operating systems.
4.	Secure Your Server: 
o	Firewall: Configure your firewall to restrict access to your Mythic server. Only allow necessary connections (e.g., SSH from your IP address).
o	Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for your Mythic user accounts.



Day 21: Mythic Agents – Deploying the Spies
With my Mythic C2 server ready, it's time to create some agents (payloads) to deploy on my target systems. Mythic is incredibly versatile, allowing me to generate agents for various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. These agents will act as my eyes and ears within the target environment, enabling me to execute commands, gather information, and even move laterally across the network.
Here's how I created and deployed Mythic agents:
1.	Generate an Agent: 
o	In the Mythic interface, navigate to the "Agents" tab.
o	Click on "Create Agent."

o	Select a payload type (e.g., an executable for Windows).
o	Configure any additional options, such as the listener to use for communication with the C2 server.
o	Click "Generate Agent."
o	Download the generated agent file.
2.	Deploy the Agent: 
o	For this simulation, I'll be deploying the agent manually to my Windows Server. In a real-world scenario, an attacker might use phishing emails, malicious websites, or other techniques to deliver the payload.
o	Copy the agent file to your Windows Server (e.g., using RDP).
3.	Execute the Agent: 
o	On the Windows Server, open a command prompt or PowerShell console and execute the agent file.
o	The agent will establish a connection to your Mythic C2 server.
4.	Interact with the Agent: 
o	In the Mythic interface, you should now see the active agent.
o	You can use the Mythic interface to interact with the agent, execute commands, and retrieve information from the compromised system.
Day 22: Kibana Alerts for Mythic – Spotting the C2
Now, let's shift gears and put on our defender hats. How do we detect Mythic C2 activity in our network? That's where the power of the ELK stack comes into play. Mythic agents communicate with the C2 server, generating network traffic and creating events that we can analyze.
Here's how I set up Kibana alerts for Mythic:
1.	Identify Mythic Traffic Patterns: 
o	Mythic offers various communication profiles (HTTP, DNS, etc.). Understand the traffic patterns associated with the profile you're using.
o	For example, if using HTTP, look for unusual user-agent strings, consistent connections to your C2 server's IP address, or specific URI patterns used by Mythic.
2.	Create Kibana Queries: 
o	In Kibana's "Discover" tab, create queries to filter events related to your Mythic C2 traffic.
o	Use fields like source.ip, destination.ip, http.user_agent, http.request.uri, and dns.question.name to identify suspicious activity.
3.	Set up Alerts: 
o	In Kibana's "Alerts" tab, create alerts based on your queries.
o	Configure the alert to trigger when a certain threshold is met (e.g., a specific number of events matching the query within a given time frame).
o	Choose how you want to be notified (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).
4.	Build a Dashboard: 
o	In Kibana's "Dashboards" tab, create a dedicated dashboard to visualize Mythic-related activity.
o	Include visualizations like maps to show the source of C2 traffic, timelines to track agent activity, and tables to display specific events.
Day 23: Ticketing Systems in the SOC – Organized Chaos
